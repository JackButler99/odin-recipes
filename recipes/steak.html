  <p>Steak isn't just a fancy meal, you can have it anytime of the week. Pair it with a Salad, Potatoes, and Asparagus for a meal that is not only restaurant-worthy, but better! </p>
  <p>The Best Steak Marinade adds so much flavor to your juicy steak. It helps to tenderize and infuse the steak with flavor and creates a unique sensation</p>
  <p>Here are some ingredients to cook our marinade steak:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>1 pinch seasoned salt</li>
    <li>1 pinch garlic powder</li>
    <li>1 teaspoons Greek seasoning</li>
    <li>1 cube chicken bouillon, crushed</li>
    <li>Â½ cup butter, melted</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Stir the seasoning salt, garlic powder, Greek seasoning, and bouillon cube into the melted butter. Mix until the bouillon cube dissolves. Pour the marinade into a wide and shallow dish and place a steak of your choice into the marinade, turning to coat both sides. Cook or grill as desired.</p>
